# Noise-robust fixation classification (I2MC) - Python implementation

## About I2MC

Original description of the MATLAB implementation from https://github.com/royhessels/I2MC:

The I2MC algorithm was designed to accomplish fixation classification in data across a wide range of noise levels and when periods of data loss may occur.

## About this implementation

This is a Python implementation of the I2MC algorithm (tested on version Python 3.8). For the original Matlab implementation see https://github.com/royhessels/I2MC

Most functions were initially ported to Python by Jonathan van Leeuwen. Diederick Niehorster and Roy Hessels updated a few functions to match the MATLAB version more closely and ported what remained.

Note that this Python implementation may be slightly different from the MATLAB version. Among the differences is a different implementation of Chebyshev filtering (the Python version uses `scipy.signal.cheby1()`, the MATLAB version uses `cheby1` from the signal processing toolbox).

The differences in output between the MATLAB and Python implementation of I2MC are visualized in Figure 1 and 2. As is visible from these Figures, slight differences in output between the MATLAB and Python implementations remain. As such, when using this Python implementation, please cite the original paper (see above) and mention that this Python implementation is used.

## Disclaimer

We take no responsibility for the correct working of this Python implementation of I2MC. We provide this solely as a service to the part of the (scientific) community that prefers Python over MATLAB. As we are not dedicated Python programmers, we welcome any bug reports, as well as improved implementations of I2MC.
